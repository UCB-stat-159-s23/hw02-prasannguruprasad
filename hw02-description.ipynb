    "For this assignment, you will take use the [LIGO Gravitational Wave Detection Tutorial Notebook](https://github.com/losc-tutorial/LOSC_Event_tutorial) and companion files that are publicly available on Github. With those, you will structure this repository as a reproducible research package, with installable utilities separated into a small Python package, a conda Environment specification and a new Binder link. \n",
    "\n",
    "While the LIGO Open Science Center did a remarkable job offering these notebooks along with supporting code and a usable Binder link, we want you to make some improvements on top of this foundation, for example making certain versions explicit to ensure long-term reproducibility, more cleanly separating the supporting utilities from the code, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LIGO project is a super interesting experiment that proved the existence of gravitational waves by measuring small fluctuations of space. You can find more information about the science behind LIGO in their [tutorials](https://www.gw-openscience.org/tutorials/)."

    "* Take advantage of the LIGO Binder to experiment with which versions of various packages it uses, so that you can add those same ones to your environment (in their original specification, they did not list specific Python versions, so they are frozen in time somewhat by accident based on when the Binder was last built).\n",
    "\n",
    "* To find a package version, you can print its `__version__` attribute after importing it in a Python environment. At the command line, you can also see the available packages in your system using `mamba list` and `pip list` respectively (depending on whether they were installed with mamba/conda or pip). You can filter the list of all the installed libraries with the `grep` command. For example, you can do `conda env export | grep numpy` to quickly find the numpy version in the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If a package on Binder has version say `1.2.3`, in your environment file you should request only `1.2`, _without_ the third digit. Some revision versions (the three version digits are normally known as major.minor.revision) may not always be available identically today, so it's a bit safer to request version X.Y than to try to get X.Y.Z and have it fail because Z is not available.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Be careful with one package that you will need to list explicitly in addition to the scientific libraries and ipykernel: `decorator`. Check its version on Binder.  If you don't request it by X.Y version, you will accidentally get a much newer version that is not compatible with Python 2.7!\n",
    "\n",
    "* Remember to install the environment for yourself, add its kernel, and start running the notebook on the hub in that environment. You will have to install `ipykernel` and then create the respective kernel in order for this to work.\n",
